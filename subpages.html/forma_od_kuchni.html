              I started the project by interview with the client. Thanks to this
              conversation I got to know the company, the people behind it, the
              company's business plan and goals. I got to know the problems
              faced by the website owners and customers. After the meeting I was
              able to plan the process of work on the project.

              on. It's a moment when client want to find informations about
              cooperation and make an appointment to dietician.

              Due to the need to download a PDF, the process of contracting with
              a dietician/trainer wasn't intuitive. It took a lot of time to
              read the information. The PDF consisted of 7 pages filled with
              text. It informed me exactly about the cooperation process but was
              overwhelming due to the amount of data and text.

            <h3>Price list</h3>
            <p>
              I added a price list tab. Now you do not have to search the whole
              website to find out about the price of cooperation.<br />
              <br />
              Thanks to business analysis, we have changed the form of the price
              list from payments for a single service to long-term cooperation.

              Now you can buy pre-established diets in the shop. Ready-made
              diets allow the dietitian to focus on working with people who want
              to collaborate for a long period.

            <h2>Next Steps & Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>
              The next step will be usability testing with potential customers.
              Through this cooperation, I have learned how business analysis
              tools and templates are useful in User Experience work. Thanks to
              them I learned about the company's goals, plans, and motivations.
              Together with my client, I created a business goal for the coming
              years. The analyses allowed me to focus on things that are
              necessary and needed not only for potential customers of the
              website but above all for business.
