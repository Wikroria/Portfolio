      <p>
        Nowadays, elderly people need safe access to food, medicines, products
        of first need, and contact with another human being. Propose a solution
        to support seniors in your village during the pandemic. Note that not
        all seniors benefit from electronic devices. By acting robustly we
        prevent further spread of the virus and we will minimize the risk for
        the elderly!

                I surveyed the city center where from morning till morning in
                the afternoon you can meet almost all the seniors. The pandemic
                period is not the best time for conducting open-air surveys.
                Most people do not she wanted to talk about the pandemic or the
                city and to help the seniors. The vast majority of people I have
                had the pleasure of talk, she thinks she's doing great on her
                own. If she's they need help asking their loved ones about it.
                When asked if would benefit from the help of a third party, e.g.
                when buying in the case of the cold, everyone denied it. They
                like . to do "their own business" in the center. It's often for
                them one of the forms of spending free time . None of the people
                surveyed have ever used the help of the city. Most were not even
                aware of the reliefs, services and the help they can count on as
                Silesian seniors.

          After talks with seniors and analysis of workshops organized by
          wyborcza.pl as part of the campaign „DługoWIECZNI” I have come to the
          following conclusions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Seniors are reluctant to admit that they need help.</li>
          <li>
            In municipalities and cities, many actions and events are organized
            to help and activate of seniors. The problem is the lack of access
            to information on what and where seniors can use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seniors, like the rest of the population, are less and less affected
            by the COVID-19 virus. They follow the recommendations, but they
            long for normality and contact with people.
          </li>
          <li>
            Senior enjoy going out. Even during a pandemic, they do not want to
            give up on leaving because they are a form of recreation and
            socializing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seniors are afraid to use some of the city's offers for financial
            reasons (they are afraid that they are paid for)

        <p>
          After analysing the existing offer to help senior citizens in times of
          pandemic, but also before the pandemic, I concluded that it is not a
          lack of offer, but a lack of information about possible assistance is
          a problem. Seniors do not know the possibilities that the city or
          province offers them.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Free guides would be available, among others, at city offices,
                at the post office so that seniors have easy access to them.
                They would provide information about relief for seniors,
                activation events, help and where to find it, health. Seniors do
                not use the Internet freely, so a paper guide containing all
                offers, actions or even phone numbers where they can look for
                help would be very useful. A clear newsletter would allow
                seniors to benefit from a wide range of offers specifically for
                them.It could also encourage seniors to take advantage of the
                aid available in their city.

              <p>
                Seniors are reluctant to ask for help. They often do not know
                about the initiatives, actions, and help offered by the city.
                Family and neighbors can be their informants and, in addition to
                help, encourage them to take advantage of the city's offer for
                seniors. A campaign to support intergenerational integration
                could appear in the city. Older people often do not want to be a
                problem for the younger generations. It would be worth showing
                them that they are not. They may ask for help or come to talk to
                younger people.

              <p>
                Seniors are rarely active on the Internet, but you can certainly
                find them in the center. This is where interactive information
                boards could be found. The curiosity of seniors would certainly
                encourage them to check what is on them. These boards would
                inform about the city's offer for the elderly, but also families
                with children and young people. Therefore, all residents of the
                city could use them. Most of the seniors would be happy that,
                apart from attractions or help for themselves, they could also
                inform their grandchildren and children about the interesting
                attractions offered by the city. This would help to maintain a
                bond and encourage interaction in times when larger meetings
                will no longer pose a health risk.
