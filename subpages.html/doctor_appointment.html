                <h1>Doctor's appointment</h1>
                <p>Case study based on a challenge made by the zebza.net blog - it's a UI challenge but I focused on the
                     UX side. The aim of the exercise was to design a part of the application used to make an appointment
                      to the dentist. The application is used by regular clients of the office, who know their doctors. 
                      They do not have to fill in any personal data. The entire exercise text on the blog zebza.net.
                </p>
                <p class="interjection">
                    For this project, I set the following requirements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I will only do it in 1–2 days
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The deliverable is a basic prototype of part of the application used to make an appointment to the doctor
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Obligatory elements of the exercise :</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Purpose of the visit

                    <li>
                        Date of the visit (possible from Monday to Friday only)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time of the visit (possible only in time-blocks, from 10:00 to 15:00)
                    </li>
                    <li>

            <h2>My solution</h2>
                    <p>I've decided to separate fields into different steps which change users' perception on how hard it is to complete and make the whole process looks easier. </p>

            </div>
            <p>When selecting the date and time, we can see which day has still free dates. Free appointments are distinguished by their colour and greater contrast, making them more visible. With a summary, we can make sure that we chose everything the way we wanted it. In this step, we can also make changes. At the end of the process we get a confirmation that our visit has been recorded, with this view we can also easily return to the main screen.</p>

                <h2>The problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the task I considered only consultations in time blocks up to 3 p.m. If appointments would took place from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. in shorter blocks, such a system wouldn't be functional. 
                        Then it would be useful to divide avaiable into morning, afternoon and evening hours so that it would be easier and faster to find a convenient time for us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I didn't design the step of the selection of the facility or doctor, but the analysis showed me that they determining influence  on the speed and quality of user experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Solving the problems</h2>
                <p>The task motivated me to get deeper into the appointment process. I decided to took a few steps back and analyze the process from the begining to the end with selecting the doctor, facility.

                <h2>Research and analyzing</h2>
          <p>For detailed process analysis I chose LUX MED application which is one of the most commonly used applications of this type in Poland. I went through the whole process as a customer journey.</p>

       <h2>Things to improve</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>home-page layout- we can use icons for quicker recognition of the type of consultation, there could be also app language selection</li>
           <li>sequence in the form- selecting service after choosing the city and facility may cause errors</li>
           <li>visit details - added information such as possible services and their price could be useful </li>
           <li>doctor information- every doctor could have his picture, it would inspire more trust and make it easier to find the doctor we already know</li>
           <li>booking confirmation - in this step a summary could be added so that the patient could check his choice and then confirm it</li>
       </ul>
    <h2>Example of solution</h2>
    <div class="container gallery">
        <div class="row ">
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
                <img src="../img/medical_project_redesign/Specialization.png" alt="Select_specialization" id="photo">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I minimized task perception by splitting the form into steps and
            I've used icons to make the election of a specialty quicker.</p>
        <div class="row ">
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">

            </div>
        </div>
            <p>The second step in the process is the choice of service. At this stage, you can check its approximate price.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I decided to add the possibility of choosing the time frame in which we are looking for a visit. This helps to make the search more precise.</p>

        <h2>What I've learned</h2>
                <p>Starting with the task was a great start to focus on the appointment process. However, the process is so complicated that it was easier for me to think about it as a whole without skipping steps. Next time I'll give myself more time for analysing and testing.</p>
