            <p>
              The "Sensorycznie i na serio" hackathon winner project in category of individuals participants who were joined together in a team in hackathon day. The „Silent Alert" application concept alerting deaf people to the dangers in the area and help them evacuate. The information is translated into sign language. The application also provides three different ways of getting help. The recipient can call the relevant service, call an interpreter, or try to get in touch with someone nearby by using the question templates.

            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>Imagine Monday morning when you get on the bus every day. You have a 20-minute drive, so you take the book out. Suddenly the bus stops, there is no stopping around, all the people get off. You see the driver screaming something, but you can't hear him. You are looking for some visual information about what is going on, but you do not find it. The message "Attention, evacuation" comes out of the speakers. The driver tells you what to do next. Unfortunately, you will not hear these messages - you are deaf. None of the passengers know sign language. To communicate, you have to use a notepad on your phone. Scared passengers strangely look at you, they are afraid, and you are still uninformed about what is happening.</p>
            <h4> Alarm situations are not always suitable for deaf people. The lack of visual warnings makes a large number of deaf people afraid to learn about the disaster too late.</h4>

           <p>
            There is no application on the market that alerts the deaf about the dangers in the area. The existing "Alarm112" application is used to forward emergency calls to the emergency number 112 without the need for voice communication. Our idea could be an extension of this application.

            <p> 
             We started the strategy of our application with a map of empathy to get to know the user more closely. We also filled in the value propositions that helped us to find solutions for users' needs. Thanks to the hackathon, we had the opportunity to conduct an in-depth interview with a representative of the deaf.

            <p>Thanks to hackon, the problems of people with disabilities have become closer to me. Lectures and conversations made me aware of the obstacles and barriers that people with disabilities face on a daily basis, making it easier for me to pay attention to accessibility issues when designing. </p>
